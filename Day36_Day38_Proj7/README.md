## Day 36 - Day 38

### @State only works with structs
Each struct copy is an independent struct, thus the value can't be shared between structs instances.  Thus the property change in one  struct won't affect the other.

With class and @ObservalbleObject, views who call the same class get the same value.

### @ObservedObject

### Showing and hiding views

### onDelete()

### UserDefaults (Store)

### Codable (Archive)
